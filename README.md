# PlaquePicker: Single-object based analysis of MSI data
Quantitative analysis of MSI datasets is typically performed on single pixels or manually assigned regions of interest (ROI). 
How-ever, many sparse, small objects such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) brain deposits of amyloid peptides called plaques are neither single pixels nor ROI. 
Here, we propose a new approach to facilitate comparative computational evaluation of amyloid plaque-like objects by MSI: 
PLAQUE PICKER is a fast tool that enables statistical evaluation of heterogeneous amyloid peptide composition and other molecularly diverse sparsely-distributed features.

This package comes with a trimmed and reduced imzML data set as a example. 
If you would like to use the same data as in the paper: 
A mass spectrometry imaging data set for each of the used mouse models has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository 
with the dataset identifier PXD020824.
