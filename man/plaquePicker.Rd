\title{Separate stack of ion images into seperated single-objects.}
\usage{
plaquePicker(ionImages, coord, method = c("tpoint", "geometric", "peak"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ionImages}{array of ion images as returned by \code{MALDIquant::msiSlices()}.}

\item{coord}{array of coordinates as returned by \code{MALDIquant::coordinates()}.}

\item{method}{character, which thresholding method to use. Set to "peak" if you do not want to apply any threhold.
In this case every signal > 0 will be considered as valid. Generate the ion images from peak picked data.}

\item{...}{Arguments past to thresholding functions.}
}
\value{
A list, on the top level the list contains one entry per provided ion image with
    \code{conComp}      matrix, with same dimensions as the provided ion image and IDs assigned to pixels belonging to the same seperte single-object.
    \code{binMat}       matrix, of ion image binarized by \code{tpoint}-function.
    \code{threshold}    numeric, the threshold estimated by \code{tpoint}-function.
    \code{spectraIdx}   list of integer vectors containing the indecies of the spectra in the list of \code{MALDIquant::massObject}.
Also, there is another entry called \code{unified}: The result of all binarized ion images combined.
    In addition to \code{conComp}, \code{binMat}, and \code{spectraIdx} that contain the equivalent matrices of the unified data as described above this entry contains the following:
    \code{intensities}  list of lists containing the intensities of the coresponding pixels for the provided ion images
}
\description{
Separate stack of ion images into seperated single-objects.

\examples{
pp <- plaquePicker(ionImages = NLGF67w_mouse1_rep1,
                   coord = NLGF67w_mouse1_rep1_coord,
                   method = "tpoint")
